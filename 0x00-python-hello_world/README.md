### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

*    Why Python programming is awesome
*    Who created Python

*    What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with PEP 8

####  0. Run Python file
Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.
The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

####  1. Run inline
Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

####  2. Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
*    Use the function print

#### 3. Print integer
Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

*    You can find the source code here
*    The output of the script should be:
        the number, followed by Battery street,
        followed by a new line
*    You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
*    Your code must be 3 lines long
*    You have to use the new print numbers tips (with .format(...))

#### 4. Print float mandatory
Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

    You can find the source code here
    The output of the program should be:
        Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
        followed by a new line
    You are not allowed to cast number to string
